<p><strong>Crabber's Delight</strong> is a mod that expands upon the cooking system from <strong>Farmer's Delight.</strong></p>
<p>It introduces more seafood into the game, including crabs, shrimps, and clams, that can all be used in a collection of new dishes as well as some other food items to expand upon the existing sealife in Minecraft.</p>
<p>📖 <strong>Getting Started:</strong></p>
<p>To get started, build a crab trap and put in the water with a 3x3 of water around it* (waterlogged blocks do count). The crab trap will start gathering items slowly. If you want to speed it up, place it in any water biome for 2x the speed. Additionally, to improve the quality of items it catches, supply it with some bait or buckets of chum.</p>
<p>*This setting can be disabled in the config</p>
